abstract: Climatic changes that have occurred over the past decades, with an
  acceleration of urbanization of territories and technological development,
  leads to the significant changes not only in the atmosphere, but also in the
  Earth’s surface. Surface water bodies are one of these components. Today there
  are 3 main methods of monitoring water bodies - field, remote and combined. In
  this paper, we show the possibility of automating remote monitoring of water
  bodies using QGIS, Python and Sentinel-2 data of the main and largest lakes of
  the Kerch Peninsula. Having analysed both the available satellite data and the
  features of the study area, we came to the conclusion that it is advisable to
  use the NDWI index instead of the mNDWI. After processing and analysing the
  Sentinel-2 data for 2018 using the data processing model presented in the
  work, we obtained time series of changes in the areas of the studied lakes of
  the Kerch Peninsula.
