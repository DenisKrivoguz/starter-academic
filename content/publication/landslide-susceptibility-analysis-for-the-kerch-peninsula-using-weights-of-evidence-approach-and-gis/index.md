abstract: Landslides are one of the most important problems on Kerch Peninsula.
  Rapidly increasing anthropogenic pressure, which has been particularly could
  be seen in recent years, leads to destabilization of slopes and significant
  economic and social damage. Nowdays, economic activities for the further
  development of Kerch Peninsula, urbanization and the construction of new
  infrastructure facilities may lead to destabilization of slopes and activation
  of landslides. Application of an integrated mathematical model, helped us to
  reflect the current state of Kerch Peninsula in the context of solving this
  problem. With the help of field research, we mapped a complex of landslide
  areas, which made it possible to identify the main types of them occurring
  here – earth and earthwork slips landslides, and in the coastal zone –
  landfalls and caving slides, total area of which reaches 87.5 km^2 (7.4% of
  the research area territory). We chose an optimal method under the given
  conditions – the weight of evidence. The approach presented in this paper
  allows us to classify the territory according to the degree of its
  susceptibility to landslides with rather high accuracy and analyze the
  existing situation in this area and analyze possible scenarios for its
  development. We zoned the territory of the Kerch peninsula into 3 classes –
  stable, unstable and unsusceptible according to the degree of landslide
  probable occurrences. The susceptibility analysis revealed that the factors
  causing the activation of landslides on the Kerch Peninsula are the slope
  steepness from 20 to 40 degrees, the anthropogenic impact, excessive salinity
  of the soil cover and the lithological composition of the terrain.
