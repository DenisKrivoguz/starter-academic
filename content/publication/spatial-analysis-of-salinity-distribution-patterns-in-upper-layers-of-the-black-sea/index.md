abstract: Salinity is one of the most important factors that primarily
  determines the level of seawater's density and, consequently, the movement of
  water masses in the World Ocean. Spatial distribution of the salinity in
  different layers of the Black Sea are associated with varying levels of water
  balance seasonal variability and, general circulation of Black Seas waters and
  in the surface layer has a seasonal structure. To study spatial distribution
  of salinity in upper layers of the Black Sea we've used data from Copernicus
  Marine Environment Monitoring Service, that were processed and aggregate by
  seasons and depth. We found that the most fluctuated layer is a top layer (up
  to 2.8 m) and the highest values Black Sea salinity reaches near the Bosporus
  Strait, where more saline water from the Sea of Marmara connected with fresher
  water of the Black Sea. Also we found that the impact of the river flows,
  mixing of the water, water regime of the sea decreasing with depth, so in the
  bottom of the upper layer the spatial fluctuation of the salinity is minimal
  and reaches about ±3‰, while in the depth of 2.8 m its reaches ±12-15‰.The
  lowest level of salinity through all of the upper layer (0-50 m) lays around
  the seashore and northwestern part of the sea.
