abstract: Various impacts of landslides have increased in past decades due to
  the rapid growth of urbanization in the developing world. Landslide effects
  have damaged many aspects of human life and the natural environment, and many
  difficulties remain for accurate assessments and evaluations. Main goal of
  this article is to analyze main topographical factors of Kerch peninsula and
  describe impact if this factors on landslide process. Factor, analyzed in this
  work include slope, steam power index, profile and plan curvature, mass
  balance index and terrain wetness index. The most important factor, that
  influenced on landslide processes is slope angles.
