abstract: "This research is devoted to the study of the impact of anthropogenic
  activity on the stability of the population and its properties. Since factors,
  such as a decrease in the feed base, based on fish catching and birds
  shooting, have a significant impact on the existence of the population. The
  relevance of the work is that at this moment intensive fisheries are being
  carried out and as a result of excessive catch, the ecosystem is declining.
  Often, this negatively affects on the food chain, mainly birds, being their
  main food base. Thus, one of the solutions in assessing this impact and
  predicting population dynamics can be the population viability analysis. The
  aim of the study is to simulate the viability of a population and assess the
  impact of the abundance of one species on the viability of the other, taking
  into account the negative factors. The practical approach of this research is
  that with the help of the developed scenario we can monitor the viability of
  the population and the probability of its extinction. This can be useful when
  decisions are needed to restore the population, to compare proposed ecosystem
  management options and assess the current situation. The main results of this
  work are scenarios, that was modeled, in which two negative factors impacts on
  the population of birds: Phalacrocorax carbo shooting and fish catching. As a
  result of the forecast of the existence of the Phalacrocorax carbo, it can be
  seen that the stable functioning of the population is possible only if two
  important environmental requirements are met, which are presented to users
  operating in the Azov-Black Sea coast. These requirements include both
  regulation of the fence hunting and hunting by the hunters of the investigated
  object"
