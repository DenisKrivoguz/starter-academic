abstract: The article discusses a modern approach to natural territories zoning
  by machine learning method. Zoning of the territory is based on an integrated
  assessment of the quality of environmental indicators, taking into account the
  maximum possible number of factors that can fully describe the properties and
  features of the analyzed territory. The purpose of the work is to form a
  modern mathematical methodology based on machine learning methods, capable of
  significantly improving modern approaches of any territory zoning. The article
  analyzes current trends in zoning for various territories. Authors have
  analyzed the zoning algorithm using clustering, and also highlighted its main
  stages, which include obtaining and normalizing data, determining the
  propensity of a dataset to be divided into sets, identifying the optimal
  number of clusters and zoning. It was concluded that the effectiveness of any
  clustering algorithm is determined by its achievement of the compactness
  hypothesis, which consists in the fact that similar objects are much more
  likely to be in the same class than in different ones. The authors highlighted
  both the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. The authors consider such
  qualities as objectivity, accuracy, simplicity of modifiability and settings
  as positive ones while the strong dependence on the quality of the data of
  carried out standardization is considered to be negative, which, with any
  significant deviations in these aspects, can lead to a significant distortion
  of the results.
